# Using Stata

On both Pod and Knot, Stata/MP 15 is available with up to 24 cores. In order to use Stata, you will need to be added to the `econ` group (contact Fuzzy Rogers - fuz(at)ucsb.edu).

## Loading Stata

To use Stata, enter the command

```
/sw/stata/stata-mp
```

To exit, enter `exit`. Specific versions of Stata can be used by entering the `version #` command.

To use the Stata GUI, connect to the servers via an XWindows environment and then enter the command

```
/sw/stata/xstata-mp
```

The GUI can be useful for viewing graphics, but will be relatively slow.

## User-written packages

User-written Stata packages can be installed by using the command `ssc install package` and should be stored inside your home directory. Point to the packages in .do files by using the command

`sysdir set PLUS dir`

where `dir` should be the path to the `ado/plus` directory inside your home folder.

## Example job files

Note that Stata has a `set processors #` command that should be included in .do files and match the requested resources in .job files (up to 24 processors).
