# Using R

R is available on both Knot and Pod, including different versions of R.

## Loading R

To load R, enter one of the commands

```
# Knot
R
```
or
```
# Pod
load module R
R
```

To exit, enter `q()`.

Note that the RStudio IDE is not available for use on the clusters.

*Remember: Most analyses should be performed on compute nodes by submitting jobs. The login node should only be used for simple analyses, testing, or debugging.*

## Versions

On Pod, the available versions of R include

```
R/3.2.2
R/3.4.4
R/3.5.1-multith
R/3.5.1
```

The default is the latest version. To load a specific version, for example, enter `load module R/3.4.4`.

On Knot, the available version of R is 3.2.2.

A different version of R can be installed inside your home directory. For more info see <http://csc.cnsi.ucsb.edu/docs/using-r-knot-braid-and-pod>.

## Packages

Packages can be installed using the R command `install.packages("package")` and should be stored inside your home folder. When using this command you may be prompted to select a CRAN mirror from which to download; select a USA (CA) mirror with an HTTPS connection for a fast and secure download. R should automatically add the home-based package library to `.libPaths()` (enter to confirm) and set it as default.
