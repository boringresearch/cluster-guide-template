# Using R

R is available on both Knot and Pod, including different versions of R. Note that the RStudio IDE is not available for use on the clusters.

## Loading R

To use R, enter one of the commands

```
# Knot
R
```
or
```
# Pod
load module R
R
```

To exit, enter `q()`.

## Versions

On Pod, the avilable versions of R include

```
R/3.2.2
R/3.4.4
R/3.5.1-multith
R/3.5.1
```

The default is the latest version. To load a specific version enter, for example, `load module R/3.4.4`.

On Knot, the available version of R is 3.2.2.

You may need to use a specific version of R that is not already installed on Pod or Knot. A different version of R can be installed inside your home directory, and your job file will need to point to this version of R.

## Packages

R packages can be installed using the command `install.packages("package")`. Packages should be stored inside your home folder. When using this command you may be prompted to select a CRAN mirror from which to download; select 140 (CA (2) - UCLA).

## Example job files
